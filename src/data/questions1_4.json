        "Confidentiality",
        "Integrity", 
        "Availability",
        "Authenticity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The CIA triad traditionally includes Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability as the three core security objectives. While Authenticity is an important security concept mentioned in the notes, it is considered an additional objective alongside Accountability, not part of the original CIA triad.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Confidentiality ensures only authorized subjects can access protected data and is a core CIA objective. Integrity ensures only authorized subjects can modify protected data and is a core CIA objective. Availability ensures information and resources are available on demand to authorized subjects and is a core CIA objective. Authenticity, while important, is an additional security objective beyond the traditional CIA triad."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The NIST Computer Security Handbook defines cyber security as 'The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of information system resources (includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications)'.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Only hardware components is too narrow as NIST includes software, firmware, data, and telecommunications. Only software applications excludes hardware, firmware, data, and telecommunications components. Physical security of buildings is just one aspect of overall security, while cyber security encompasses the complete information system including digital components and data."

      "why_others_wrong": "Hacktivists are activists who conduct hacking for political or ideological goals and typically have moderate understanding of security techniques. State-sponsored hackers are government-backed professionals who conduct advanced cyberattacks and have high expertise.

      "question": "What is the primary purpose of footers/trailers in network packets?",
      "options": [
        "To identify the sender",
        "To contain error-checking data and timestamps",
        "To encrypt the payload", 
        "To compress the data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Footers (trailers) are placed at the end of packets and typically contain error-checking information like checksums and frame check sequences, along with timing information.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Sender identification is typically in headers, not footers. Payload encryption is done by security protocols, not footers. Data compression is handled by compression algorithms, not packet footers."
