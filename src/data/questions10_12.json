    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a firewall in network security?",
      "options": [
        "To encrypt all network traffic",
        "To establish a controlled link between networks and filter traffic based on security policies",
        "To detect malware in files",
        "To provide user authentication"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A firewall establishes a controlled link between networks (typically between internal network and Internet) and filters traffic based on defined security policies, acting as a perimeter defense mechanism.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Encryption is handled by cryptographic protocols, not firewalls. Malware detection is done by antivirus software. User authentication is handled by authentication systems, though firewalls may have some authentication features."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which type of firewall examines packets individually without maintaining connection state information?",
      "options": [
        "Stateful filtering firewall",
        "Application proxy firewall",
        "Packet filtering (stateless) firewall",
        "Circuit-level gateway"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Packet filtering firewalls (also called stateless firewalls) examine each packet individually based on IP and TCP header information without keeping track of connection states or previous packets.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Stateful firewalls maintain connection state information. Application proxy firewalls examine application-layer content. Circuit-level gateways maintain connection information between endpoints."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What is the main advantage of a stateful filtering firewall over a packet filtering firewall?",
      "options": [
        "It processes packets faster",
        "It uses less memory",
        "It maintains connection state information and can track TCP sequence numbers",
        "It requires no configuration"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Stateful firewalls maintain a directory of outbound TCP connections and track sequence numbers, providing better security by understanding the context of network communications and preventing attacks that depend on sequence number manipulation.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Stateful firewalls are actually slower due to additional processing. They use more memory to maintain state tables. They require more complex configuration than simple packet filters."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which firewall type acts as a relay for application-level traffic and requires proxy code for each application?",
      "options": [
        "Packet filtering firewall",
        "Stateful filtering firewall",
        "Application proxy firewall",
        "Host-based firewall"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Application proxy firewalls (also called application-level gateways) act as relays for application-level traffic and require specific proxy code for each application they support, providing deep packet inspection at the application layer.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Packet filtering firewalls work at network/transport layers. Stateful firewalls track connections but don't act as application relays. Host-based firewalls protect individual hosts but don't necessarily act as application proxies."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "What does a circuit-level gateway primarily do?",
      "options": [
        "Examines application data content",
        "Sets up two TCP connections and relays TCP segments without examining contents",
        "Filters packets based on IP addresses only",
        "Encrypts all traffic passing through it"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A circuit-level gateway sets up two TCP connections (one with the internal client, one with the external server) and relays TCP segments between them without examining the actual content, focusing on connection-level security.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Application proxies examine application data. Packet filters examine IP addresses but don't set up dual connections. Circuit-level gateways don't provide encryption services."

        "Router, Switch, and Hub",
        "Encryption, Authentication, and Authorization"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "An IDS comprises three logical components: Sensors (collect data from various sources), Analyzers (determine if intrusion has occurred), and User Interface (view output or control system behavior).",
      "why_others_wrong": "The first option lists different security tools, not IDS components. The third option lists network hardware. The fourth option lists security services, not IDS architectural components."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Which IDS analysis approach uses a set of known malicious data patterns or attack rules?",
      "options": [
        "Anomaly detection",
        "Behavioral analysis",
        "Signature/Heuristic detection",
        "Statistical analysis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Signature/Heuristic detection (also known as misuse detection) uses a set of known malicious data patterns or attack rules that are compared with current behavior to identify known attacks.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Anomaly detection compares current behavior against normal baseline behavior. Behavioral and statistical analysis are forms of anomaly detection, not signature-based detection."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is the main limitation of signature-based detection in IDS?",
      "options": [
        "It generates too many false positives",
        "It consumes too much processing power",
        "It can only identify known attacks for which it has patterns or rules",
        "It requires constant internet connectivity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Signature-based detection can only identify attacks that match its existing database of known attack patterns or rules, making it ineffective against new, unknown, or zero-day attacks.",
      "why_others_wrong": "While false positives can occur, the main limitation is inability to detect unknown attacks. Processing power and internet connectivity are operational considerations, not fundamental limitations."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which type of attacks are most suitable for anomaly detection in IDS?",
      "options": [
        "Application layer reconnaissance attacks",
        "Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, scanning, and worms",
        "Transport layer attacks only",
        "Physical security breaches"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Anomaly detection is particularly effective for DoS attacks, scanning, and worms because these attacks typically create unusual traffic patterns that deviate significantly from normal network behavior.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Application and transport layer reconnaissance attacks often mimic normal traffic patterns. Physical security breaches are outside the scope of network-based IDS anomaly detection."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is the primary difference between Host-based IDS (HIDS) and Network-based IDS (NIDS)?",
      "options": [
        "HIDS is more expensive than NIDS",
        "HIDS monitors activity on individual systems while NIDS monitors network traffic",
        "HIDS only detects external threats while NIDS detects internal threats",
        "HIDS uses signature detection while NIDS uses anomaly detection"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "HIDS monitors activity on individual host systems (files, logs, system calls) while NIDS monitors network traffic at selected points in the network infrastructure.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Cost varies by implementation. Both can detect internal and external threats. Both can use signature-based or anomaly-based detection methods."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "What does an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) provide that an IDS does not?",
      "options": [
        "Better detection accuracy",
        "Real-time monitoring",
        "The capability to block or prevent detected malicious activity",
        "Lower false positive rates"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "An IPS extends IDS functionality by including the capability to actively block or prevent detected malicious activity, not just detect and alert about it.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Detection accuracy depends on configuration and rules, not system type. Both IDS and IPS can provide real-time monitoring. False positive rates depend on tuning, not whether it's IDS or IPS."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "What is a key advantage of Host-based IPS (HIPS) over Network-based IPS (NIPS)?",
      "options": [
        "HIPS monitors more network traffic",
        "HIPS can be tailored to the specific platform and provides additional layer of protection",
        "HIPS is easier to deploy across large networks",
        "HIPS has lower resource consumption"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "HIPS can be specifically tailored to the host platform environment and provides an additional layer of protection that is independent of network topology, offering more granular control over individual systems.",
      "why_others_wrong": "HIPS doesn't monitor network traffic directly. NIPS is easier to deploy across networks from central points. HIPS typically consumes more local system resources."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Which IPS method involves using rules and algorithms to identify potentially malicious behavior without requiring exact signatures?",
      "options": [
        "Signature-based detection",
        "Anomaly-based detection",
        "Heuristic-based detection",
        "Protocol analysis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Heuristic-based detection uses rules and algorithms to identify potentially malicious behavior based on characteristics and patterns, making it capable of detecting previously unknown threats like zero-day attacks.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Signature-based detection requires exact patterns. Anomaly-based detection compares against normal baselines. Protocol analysis focuses on protocol compliance, not behavioral heuristics."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a honeypot in network security?",
      "options": [
        "To encrypt sensitive data",
        "To provide backup storage",
        "To lure attackers away from critical systems and collect information about their activities",
        "To increase network bandwidth"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Honeypots are decoy systems designed to lure potential attackers away from critical systems, collect information about attack methods, and keep attackers engaged long enough for administrators to respond.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Honeypots don't provide encryption, backup storage, or bandwidth enhancement. Their purpose is deception and intelligence gathering."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "What is the main difference between low interaction and high interaction honeypots?",
      "options": [
        "Low interaction honeypots are more expensive",
        "High interaction honeypots are real systems with full OS and applications, while low interaction honeypots emulate services",
        "Low interaction honeypots can only detect external attacks",
        "High interaction honeypots require less monitoring"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "High interaction honeypots are actual real systems with complete operating systems and applications, providing realistic targets that can occupy attackers for extended periods, while low interaction honeypots only emulate specific services or systems.",
      "why_others_wrong": "High interaction honeypots are typically more expensive. Both can detect various attack types. High interaction honeypots require more intensive monitoring due to their realistic nature."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "Which requirement is essential for effective honeypot deployment?",
      "options": [
        "High processing power",
        "Isolation from production systems to contain malicious activity",
        "Direct internet connectivity",
        "Integration with email systems"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Isolation is critical for honeypots to contain and study malicious activity without putting actual production systems at risk, while still providing realistic interaction for attackers.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Processing power varies by honeypot type. Direct internet connectivity isn't always required. Email integration is not a fundamental requirement for honeypot effectiveness."

      "id": 17,
      "question": "What does AAA stand for in cybersecurity?",
      "options": [
        "Access, Authorization, and Auditing",
        "Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability",
        "Authentication, Access, and Analysis",
        "Authorization, Auditing, and Analysis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "AAA stands for Authentication (verifying identity), Authorization (determining what authenticated users can access), and Accountability (tracking and logging user actions).",
      "why_others_wrong": "The other combinations mix up the correct terms or include terms not part of the standard AAA framework."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Which access control function answers the question 'Who is asking to access the asset?'",

        "Authentication",
        "Authorization",
        "Identification",
        "Accountability"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Identification is the process where subjects supply identifying information (like username, user ID, account number) to indicate who they claim to be.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Authentication verifies the claimed identity. Authorization determines what they can access. Accountability tracks their actions."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "What is the difference between the policy definition phase and policy enforcement phase in access control?",
      "options": [
        "Policy definition creates rules while policy enforcement monitors compliance",
        "Policy definition defines who has access and what they can use, while policy enforcement grants/rejects access requests based on those definitions",
        "Policy definition is done by users while policy enforcement is done by administrators",
        "There is no practical difference between the two phases"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Policy definition phase establishes who has access and what systems/resources they can use (tied to authorization), while policy enforcement phase grants or rejects actual access requests based on those predefined policies (tied to identification, authentication, and accountability).",
      "why_others_wrong": "The first option confuses policy definition with compliance monitoring. The third option incorrectly assigns roles. The phases have distinct and important differences."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "What does the security kernel do in access control systems?",
      "options": [
        "Provides network connectivity",
        "Enforces access control by intercepting requests and checking them against security rules",
        "Manages file storage",
        "Handles user interface design"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The security kernel serves as the central point of access control enforcement, intercepting all access requests and checking them against its rules database to allow or deny access.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Network connectivity, file storage, and user interfaces are separate system functions not directly related to access control enforcement."
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Which authentication type involves 'something you know'?",
      "options": [

        "Knowledge-based authentication using passwords or PINs",
        "Location-based authentication"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Knowledge-based authentication (something you know) includes passwords, passphrases, and PIN numbers that rely on information the user memorizes.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Biometrics are 'something you are', tokens are 'something you have', and location is 'somewhere you are'."
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous tokens in authentication?",
      "options": [
        "Synchronous tokens work offline while asynchronous need internet",
        "Synchronous tokens calculate numbers at both server and device, while asynchronous tokens are fixed with no calculation needed",
        "Synchronous tokens are more secure",
        "There is no practical difference"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Synchronous tokens calculate time-based or event-based numbers that must match calculations on the authentication server, while asynchronous tokens (like smart cards) are fixed and only require proving physical possession.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Internet connectivity is not the distinguishing factor. Security depends on implementation. There are significant operational differences between the two types."

      "explanation": "Biometric authentication represents 'something you are' and includes both static characteristics (fingerprints, facial features, hand geometry) and dynamic characteristics (voice patterns, keystroke dynamics).",
      "why_others_wrong": "Passwords are 'something you know', smart cards are 'something you have', and location is 'somewhere you are'."

      "question": "What is Discretionary Access Control (DAC)?",
      "options": [
        "Access control where administrators make all decisions",
        "Access control where the information owner decides who gets access to the system",
        "Access control based on security clearance levels",
        "Access control that changes randomly"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In Discretionary Access Control (DAC), the information owner has the discretion to decide who gets access to their resources, making it user-controlled rather than administrator-controlled.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Administrator-controlled access is non-discretionary. Security clearance-based access is Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Random changes don't represent any standard access control model."
    },
    {
      "id": 25,

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Mandatory Access Control (MAC) uses security labels on objects and clearance levels for subjects, commonly implemented in military and government systems with classifications like Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential.",
      "why_others_wrong": "DAC is owner-controlled. RBAC is based on user roles. ABAC uses attributes of users, resources, and environment."

      "options": [
        "Users can grant access to others",
        "Access is based on 'if X then Y' programming rules and predefined conditions",
        "Access is determined by security clearance",
        "Access is based on user location only"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Rule-Based Access Control uses specific 'if X then Y' programming rules that must be met before access is granted, allowing for fine-grained control based on various conditions like time, location, or other circumstances.",
      "why_others_wrong": "User-granted access is DAC. Security clearance is MAC. Location-only access is too narrow and doesn't encompass the full rule-based approach."

        "DIAMETER",
        "PAP"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "TACACS+ uses TCP as its transport protocol (unlike RADIUS which uses UDP) and provides more sophisticated authentication steps and tighter control over complex authorization activities.",
      "why_others_wrong": "RADIUS uses UDP. DIAMETER is newer and also uses TCP but the question specifically refers to the comparison with RADIUS. PAP is a simple authentication protocol, not a comprehensive AAA protocol."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to have one password that provides access to all corporate and back-office systems they need for their job functions, improving both security and usability.",
      "why_others_wrong": "Multiple passwords would be the opposite of SSO. Automatic password changing is a different security feature. SSO still requires authentication, usually with one master password."
