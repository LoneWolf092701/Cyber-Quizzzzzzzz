While Authenticity is an important security concept mentioned in the notes, it is considered an additional objective alongside Accountability, not part of the original CIA triad.",why_others_wrong:"Confidentiality ensures only authorized subjects can access protected data and is a core CIA objective. Integrity ensures only authorized subjects can modify protected data and is a core CIA objective. Availability ensures information and resources are available on demand to authorized subjects and is a core CIA objective."},{id:2,question:"According to NIST, what does Cyber Security primarily aim to protect?",options:["Only hardware components","Integrity, availability, and confidentiality of information system resources","Only software applications","Physical security of buildings"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"The NIST Computer Security Handbook defines cyber security as 'The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of information system resources (includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications)'.",why_others_wrong:"Only hardware components is too narrow as NIST includes software, firmware, data, and telecommunications. Only software applications excludes hardware, firmware, data, and telecommunications components. Physical security of buildings is just one aspect of overall security, while cyber security encompasses the complete information system."},{id:3,question:"Which type of hacker is characterized as using other people's tools with limited knowledge?",options:["Script Kiddies","Hacktivists","State-sponsored hackers","Professional hackers"],correctAnswer:0,explanation:"Script Kiddies are defined in the notes as hackers who use other people's tools with limited knowledge and often perform attacks without actually understanding them.",why_others_wrong:"Hacktivists are activists who conduct hacking for political or ideological goals and typically have moderate understanding of security techniques. State-sponsored hackers are government-backed professionals who conduct advanced cyberattacks and have high expertise. Professional hackers (also called crackers) are highly experienced individuals who exploit complex vulnerabilities for financial gain."},{id:4,question:"What is the first stage in the modern hacking methodology?",options:["Scanning and enumeration","Reconnaissance","Gaining Access","Maintaining Access"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"According to the lecture notes, the modern hacking methodology contains five distinct stages, with Reconnaissance being the first stage. This involves gathering information using passive attacks and OSINT before moving to other stages.",why_others_wrong:"Scanning and enumeration is the second stage that comes after reconnaissance. Gaining access is the third stage where attackers exploit discovered vulnerabilities. Maintaining access is the fourth stage where attackers establish persistent presence after gaining initial access."},{id:5,question:"Which security design principle suggests that access decisions should be based on permission rather than exclusion?",options:["Least Privilege","Complete Mediation","Open Design","Fail-Safe Defaults"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Fail-Safe Defaults principle states that 'Access decisions should be based on permission rather than exclusion - Default access is denied unless explicitly allowed.'",why_others_wrong:"Least Privilege focuses on ensuring every process and user operates with minimal necessary permissions. Complete Mediation requires that every access must be checked against access control mechanisms. Open Design advocates that security mechanism designs should be open rather than secret."},{id:6,question:"In the DREAD threat modeling, what does the 'R' stand for?",options:["Reproducibility","Risk","Recovery","Responsibility"],correctAnswer:0,explanation:"In DREAD threat modeling, the 'R' stands for Reproducibility, which measures how easy it is for the attack to occur or to replicate. The DREAD model consists of Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability.",why_others_wrong:"Risk is a general security concept but not what the R represents in DREAD. Recovery relates to incident response but is not part of the DREAD model. Responsibility relates to accountability but is not a component of DREAD threat modeling."},{id:7,question:"Which type of attack surface refers to vulnerabilities created by personnel or outsiders through social engineering?",options:["Network attack surface","Human attack surface","Software attack surface","Physical attack surface"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Human attack surface refers to vulnerabilities created by personnel or outsiders, such as social engineering, human error, and trusted insiders.",why_others_wrong:"Network attack surface refers to vulnerabilities over enterprise networks, WANs, or Internet connections. Software attack surface involves vulnerabilities in application, utility, or operating system code. Physical attack surface, while related to human interaction, specifically refers to physical access vulnerabilities rather than social engineering."},{id:8,question:"What type of social engineering involves 'the subtle extraction of information during an apparently normal and innocent conversation'?",options:["Pretexting","Influence","Elicitation","Baiting"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Elicitation is defined in the notes as 'the subtle extraction of information during an apparently normal and innocent conversation.'",why_others_wrong:"Pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario or story during a social engineering engagement. Influence focuses on persuasion techniques involving emotions and beliefs. Baiting involves leaving malicious items (like USB drives) for victims to find and use."},{id:9,question:"Which security control category includes policies, guidelines, and manuals?",options:["Administrative controls","Technical controls","Physical controls","Operational controls"],correctAnswer:0,explanation:"Administrative controls are non-technical controls that include policies, guidelines, manuals, and other management-focused security measures.",why_others_wrong:"Technical controls involve hardware and software security capabilities like firewalls and encryption. Physical controls include locks, cameras, security guards, and physical barriers. Operational controls address implementation and use of security policies through procedures primarily implemented by people."},{id:10,question:"In attack trees, what do the leaf nodes represent?",options:["The main security goal","Different ways to initiate an attack","The cost of the attack","The success probability"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"According to the notes, 'The final nodes on the paths outward from the root, the leaf nodes, represent different ways to initiate an attack.'",why_others_wrong:"The main security goal is represented by the root node of the attack tree. The cost of the attack can be labeled on branches but is not what leaf nodes represent. Success probability might be calculated but leaf nodes specifically represent attack initiation methods."},{id:11,question:"What is the primary purpose of a Local Area Network (LAN)?",options:["Connect systems over large geographic areas","Connect personal devices like smartphones","Provide network connectivity for computers in the same geographic area","Provide internet access only"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"LANs provide network connectivity for computers located in the same geographic area, typically connected through devices like hubs and switches.",why_others_wrong:"Connecting systems over large geographic areas is the purpose of WANs (Wide Area Networks). Connecting personal devices like smartphones is the purpose of PANs (Personal Area Networks). Providing internet access only is too narrow since LANs provide local network connectivity and can function without internet access."},{id:12,question:"How many layers does the OSI reference model have?",options:["5","6","7","8"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"The OSI Reference Model has 7 layers: Physical (1), Data Link (2), Network (3), Transport (4), Session (5), Presentation (6), and Application (7).",why_others_wrong:"5 layers would be insufficient to represent all the distinct functions needed in network communication. 6 layers would miss one crucial communication function. 8 layers would add unnecessary complexity beyond what the OSI model defines."},{id:13,question:"Which OSI layer is responsible for routing data and logical addressing?",options:["Transport Layer","Network Layer","Data Link Layer","Session Layer"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"The Network Layer (Layer 3) is responsible for the logical implementation of the network, including routing data and logical addressing (like IP addresses).",why_others_wrong:"Transport Layer (Layer 4) handles end-to-end communication and breaking data into packets. Data Link Layer (Layer 2) handles physical addressing (MAC addresses) and frame preparation. Session Layer (Layer 5) handles creating, maintaining, and disconnecting communication sessions."},{id:14,question:"In the TCP/IP model, how many layers are there?",options:["3","4","5","7"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"The TCP/IP model has 4 layers: Physical Layer (1), Network Layer (2), Transport Layer (3), and Application Layer (4). This model combines some of the OSI layers for a more practical approach.",why_others_wrong:"3 layers would be too few to represent the distinct functions needed. 5 layers would add unnecessary complexity to the TCP/IP model. 7 layers is the OSI model, not the TCP/IP model."},{id:15,question:"What does encapsulation mean in networking?",options:["Removing headers from packets","Encrypting data","A packet of one protocol being placed as payload in another protocol's packet","Compressing data"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Encapsulation occurs when 'A packet p1 of N1 is encapsulated into a packet p2 of N2' where 'The payload of p2 is p1'. This allows one protocol to use the services of another protocol.",why_others_wrong:"Removing headers from packets is de-encapsulation, not encapsulation. Encrypting data is a security function, not the networking concept of encapsulation. Compressing data is a data optimization technique, not encapsulation."},{id:16,question:"Which HTTP response status code indicates 'OK' (success)?",options:["404","301","200","500"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"HTTP status code 200 means 'OK' indicating successful completion of the request.",why_others_wrong:"404 means 'Not Found' indicating the requested resource doesn't exist. 301 means 'Moved Permanently' indicating the resource has been relocated. 500 indicates an internal server error."},{id:17,question:"What is the main difference between TCP and UDP protocols?",options:["TCP is faster than UDP","UDP is connection-oriented, TCP is connectionless","There is no difference","TCP is connection-oriented and reliable, UDP is connectionless"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"TCP is connection-oriented and reliable, providing sequence numbers, timeouts, and retransmissions. UDP is connectionless and lightweight with no connection to create/maintain and no guarantee of packet delivery.",why_others_wrong:"TCP is actually slower than UDP due to its overhead and reliability mechanisms. UDP is connectionless while TCP is connection-oriented, not the reverse. There are significant differences between these protocols in terms of reliability, connection management, and overhead."},{id:18,question:"In the TCP three-way handshake, what is the correct order of flags?",options:["SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK","ACK, SYN, FIN","SYN, ACK, FIN","FIN, ACK, SYN"],correctAnswer:0,explanation:"The TCP three-way handshake follows the sequence: (1) Client sends SYN, (2) Server sends SYN-ACK, (3) Client sends ACK. This establishes a reliable connection before data transfer begins.",why_others_wrong:"ACK, SYN, FIN is incorrect as ACK cannot come before SYN establishment. SYN, ACK, FIN includes FIN which is for connection termination, not establishment. FIN, ACK, SYN starts with connection termination rather than establishment."},{id:19,question:"What does ARP stand for and what is its purpose?",options:["Address Routing Protocol - routes packets","Address Resolution Protocol - maps IP addresses to MAC addresses","Application Response Protocol - handles responses","Automatic Repeat Protocol - retransmits data"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) connects the network layer to the data layer by mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses. When a device needs to send data, it uses ARP to find the destination device's MAC address.",why_others_wrong:"Address Routing Protocol would be about routing, not address resolution. Application Response Protocol would handle application-level responses, not address mapping. Automatic Repeat Protocol would handle retransmission, not address resolution."},{id:20,question:"How many bits is a MAC address?",options:["32 bits","64 bits","128 bits","48 bits"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"A MAC address is a 48-bit number usually represented in hexadecimal format (e.g., 00-1A-92-D4-BF-86).",why_others_wrong:"32 bits is the length of IPv4 addresses, not MAC addresses. 64 bits is not the standard MAC address length. 128 bits is the length of IPv6 addresses, not MAC addresses."},{id:21,question:"In IPv4 addressing, how many bits are used?",options:["16 bits","32 bits","64 bits","128 bits"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"IPv4 uses 32 bits divided into 4 parts of 8 bits each, separated by dots (dotted decimal notation).",why_others_wrong:"16 bits would be too short to provide enough unique addresses. 64 bits is not used by any standard IP version. 128 bits is used by IPv6, not IPv4."},{id:22,question:"What is the purpose of DHCP?",options:["To encrypt network traffic","To provide dynamic IP address assignment and network configuration","To route packets between networks","To resolve domain names"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) simplifies network configuration by dynamically providing computers with IPv4 addresses, subnet masks, and other essential communication information.",why_others_wrong:"Encrypting network traffic is done by protocols like TLS/SSL, not DHCP. Routing packets between networks is done by routers and routing protocols. Resolving domain names is done by DNS, not DHCP."},{id:23,question:"Which network device knows the MAC address of systems connected to each port?",options:["Hub","Router","Repeater","Switch"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Switches maintain a MAC address table that maps MAC addresses to specific ports, allowing them to intelligently forward frames to the correct destination port.",why_others_wrong:"Hubs operate at the physical layer and simply repeat signals to all ports without intelligence about MAC addresses. Routers work with IP addresses at Layer 3, not MAC addresses at Layer 2. Repeaters simply amplify signals without processing addresses."},{id:24,question:"What does DNS stand for and what is its primary function?",options:["Data Network Service - transfers data","Dynamic Network Security - provides security","Distributed Network Storage - stores files","Domain Name System - maps domain names to IP addresses"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"DNS (Domain Name System) is an application-layer protocol for mapping domain names to IP addresses. It provides a distributed database that stores various resource records.",why_others_wrong:"Data Network Service would be about data transfer, not name resolution. Dynamic Network Security would be about security services, not name resolution. Distributed Network Storage would be about file storage, not name resolution."},{id:25,question:"What happens when a network interface is set to promiscuous mode?",options:["It only receives packets intended for it","It captures all traffic it can hear on the network","It stops working entirely","It only sends packets"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"In promiscuous mode (also called monitor mode), a network interface captures all traffic it can hear, not just packets intended for it. This mode is used by hackers and pen-testers for traffic sniffing.",why_others_wrong:"Only receiving packets intended for it describes normal mode, not promiscuous mode. Stopping work entirely would indicate a malfunction, not a configuration mode. Only sending packets would not be useful for network monitoring or analysis."},{id:26,question:"What type of attack involves sending packets from one IP address that appear to originate from another?",options:["Session hijacking","ARP poisoning","IP Spoofing","DNS pharming"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"IP Spoofing is an attempt by an intruder to send packets from one IP address that appear to originate from another IP address.",why_others_wrong:"Session hijacking involves taking over an existing authenticated session. ARP poisoning involves manipulating MAC address mappings, not IP addresses. DNS pharming involves redirecting DNS queries to malicious servers."},{id:27,question:"Which type of port scan is described as 'half open' because it doesn't complete the full TCP connection?",options:["TCP Connect scan","UDP scan","FIN scan","TCP SYN scan"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"TCP SYN scan is commonly referred to as 'half open' because it sends SYN packets but doesn't complete the full three-way handshake, making it stealthier than full connection scans.",why_others_wrong:"TCP Connect scan completes the full three-way handshake, making it 'fully open'. UDP scan doesn't use TCP connections at all. FIN scan sends FIN packets to closed connections, not SYN packets for half-open connections."},{id:28,question:"In session hijacking, what does the attacker typically need to do to the legitimate client?",options:["Send them a virus","Conduct a DoS attack to make them unavailable","Steal their password","Physical access to their computer"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"In session hijacking, the attacker often conducts a DoS attack on the client to prevent them from sending new data that would shift sequence numbers forward, maintaining control of the hijacked session.",why_others_wrong:"Sending a virus is not necessary for session hijacking as it works at the network level. Stealing passwords is not required since the attack hijacks an already authenticated session. Physical access is not needed as session hijacking is a network-based attack."},{id:29,question:"What is the main goal of a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack?",options:["To crash the server","To steal passwords only","To intercept and potentially modify communications between two hosts","To flood the network with traffic"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"In a MITM attack, an attacker positions themselves between two communicating parties to intercept, monitor, and potentially modify their communications.",why_others_wrong:"Crashing the server would be a denial of service attack, not MITM. Stealing passwords only is too narrow since MITM can intercept all communications. Flooding the network with traffic describes a DDoS attack, not MITM."},{id:30,question:"Which attack involves sending false ARP responses to associate the attacker's MAC address with a legitimate IP address?",options:["IP spoofing","ARP spoofing/poisoning","DNS poisoning","Session hijacking"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"ARP spoofing/poisoning manipulates the ARP cache by sending forged ARP packets, tricking devices into associating the attacker's MAC address with a legitimate IP address.",why_others_wrong:"IP spoofing involves falsifying the source IP address in packets, not ARP responses. DNS poisoning involves corrupting DNS cache entries, not ARP entries. Session hijacking involves taking over existing sessions, not manipulating address mappings."},{id:31,question:"What is the primary characteristic of a sniffer in promiscuous mode?",options:["It only captures encrypted traffic","It only captures traffic from specific IP addresses","It cannot capture any traffic","It captures all traffic regardless of destination address"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"When a network adapter is in promiscuous mode, a sniffer captures all traffic it can hear on the network segment, regardless of the intended destination address.",why_others_wrong:"Capturing only encrypted traffic would miss unencrypted communications. Capturing traffic from specific IP addresses describes filtered monitoring, not promiscuous mode. Being unable to capture any traffic would make the sniffer useless."},{id:32,question:"Which protocol is particularly vulnerable to sniffing attacks?",options:["HTTPS","SSH","HTTP","TLS"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"HTTP is designed to send information in clear text without any protection, making it highly vulnerable to sniffing attacks where attackers can read transmitted data.",why_others_wrong:"HTTPS encrypts HTTP traffic using TLS/SSL, protecting it from sniffing. SSH provides encrypted remote access, making it resistant to sniffing. TLS encrypts data in transit, specifically designed to prevent sniffing attacks."},{id:33,question:"What is the goal of MAC flooding attack?",options:["To steal MAC addresses","To change MAC addresses","To encrypt MAC addresses","To overwhelm the switch's CAM table causing it to fail"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"MAC flooding aims to flood the switch with fake MAC addresses, overwhelming the Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table and causing the switch to fail or operate in hub mode.",why_others_wrong:"Stealing MAC addresses would be reconnaissance, not flooding. Changing MAC addresses is MAC spoofing, not flooding. Encrypting MAC addresses is not the purpose of MAC flooding attacks."},{id:34,question:"In a Smurf attack, what does the attacker do?",options:["Sends UDP packets to random ports","Sends ICMP broadcast with spoofed IP of the victim","Floods TCP SYN packets","Performs ARP poisoning"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"In a Smurf attack, the attacker sends ICMP broadcast packets with the victim's spoofed IP address, causing all devices on the network to respond to the victim, creating a distributed denial of service.",why_others_wrong:"Sending UDP packets to random ports describes a UDP flood attack. Flooding TCP SYN packets describes a SYN flood attack. Performing ARP poisoning is a different attack that manipulates address resolution tables."},{id:35,question:"What characterizes a SYN flood attack?",options:["Completing TCP handshakes normally","Sending only ACK packets","Sending FIN packets","Sending SYN packets without completing the handshake"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"A SYN flood attack sends numerous SYN packets to initiate TCP connections but never completes the handshake, exhausting the server's connection resources as it waits for responses that never come.",why_others_wrong:"Completing TCP handshakes normally would not constitute an attack. Sending only ACK packets without established connections would be ignored by the server. Sending FIN packets attempts to close connections that don't exist."},{id:36,question:"What is the difference between DoS and DDoS attacks?",options:["No difference","DoS uses one source, DDoS uses multiple distributed sources","DDoS is weaker than DoS","DoS targets applications, DDoS targets networks"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"DoS (Denial of Service) attacks originate from a single source, while DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks use hundreds or thousands of systems simultaneously, making them much more powerful.",why_others_wrong:"There are significant differences between DoS and DDoS attacks. DDoS is typically stronger than DoS due to distributed resources. Both DoS and DDoS can target applications, networks, or services - the difference is in attack source distribution."},{id:37,question:"What is a botnet in the context of DDoS attacks?",options:["A network of infected devices (zombies) controlled by an attacker","A single infected computer","A type of firewall","An antivirus program"],correctAnswer:0,explanation:"A botnet is a network of compromised devices (called zombies or bots) that are remotely controlled by an attacker and can be commanded to participate in coordinated attacks like DDoS.",why_others_wrong:"A single infected computer would be just one bot, not a botnet which requires multiple devices. A firewall is a defensive security device, not an attack network. An antivirus program is security software designed to detect and remove malware."},{id:38,question:"According to the notes, what peak traffic did IoT botnets generate in a 2020 DDoS attack on Amazon Web Services?",options:["1.5 Tbps","2.3 Tbps","3.1 Tbps","4.2 Tbps"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"According to the lecture notes, IoT devices participating in botnets generated at peak 2.3 Tbps during a DDoS attack on Amazon Web Services in 2020.",why_others_wrong:"1.5 Tbps, 3.1 Tbps, and 4.2 Tbps are not the figures mentioned in the course materials for this specific attack on AWS."},{id:39,question:"What is the primary goal of cryptography?",options:["Only to hide data","To provide confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation","Only to encrypt files","To compress data"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Cryptography aims to meet four fundamental goals: Confidentiality (protecting data secrecy), Integrity (preventing unauthorized changes), Authentication (verifying identity), and Non-repudiation (preventing denial of actions).",why_others_wrong:"Only hiding data focuses on just confidentiality, missing integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. Only encrypting files is too narrow and misses other cryptographic applications. Compressing data is data optimization, not a cryptographic goal."},{id:40,question:"Which Boolean operation is most commonly used in cryptographic applications?",options:["AND","OR","XOR","NOT"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"XOR (Exclusive OR) is the most important and commonly used Boolean operation in cryptographic applications because it outputs 1 only when inputs differ, making it ideal for encryption operations.",why_others_wrong:"AND operation outputs 1 only when both inputs are 1, which is less useful for encryption. OR operation outputs 1 when at least one input is 1, which doesn't provide the reversible property needed. NOT operation simply inverts bits but doesn't combine two inputs like XOR."},{id:41,question:"What is the result of 11 mod 7?",options:["3","4","5","6"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"The modulo operation gives the remainder after division. 11 divided by 7 equals 1 with remainder 4, so 11 mod 7 = 4.",why_others_wrong:"3 would be the result if the division were different. 5 and 6 are larger than the divisor 7, which is impossible for a modulo result since the remainder must be less than the divisor."},{id:42,question:"In cryptography, what is the difference between confusion and diffusion?",options:["No difference","Confusion is weaker than diffusion","They are the same operation","Confusion obscures plaintext-key relationship, diffusion spreads changes throughout ciphertext"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Confusion occurs when the relationship between plaintext and key is complex, making it hard to determine the key. Diffusion occurs when a change in plaintext results in multiple, widespread changes throughout the ciphertext.",why_others_wrong:"There are significant differences between confusion and diffusion - they serve different purposes. Neither is inherently weaker than the other as they address different security aspects.

A hash function produces fixed-size output and is not reversible like Caesar cipher. An asymmetric encryption method uses key pairs, while Caesar cipher uses a single shift value."},{id:44,question:"What is the main difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?",options:["Symmetric is slower","Symmetric uses the same key for encryption and decryption, asymmetric uses different keys","Asymmetric is weaker","No difference"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of mathematically related but different keys (public and private).",why_others_wrong:"Symmetric is actually faster than asymmetric encryption, not slower.

UDP is not inherently more secure than TCP. UDP is actually faster than TCP due to less overhead."},{id:66,question:"What is banner grabbing in the context of network reconnaissance?",options:["Stealing network banners","Creating fake banners","Probing services to obtain information about versions and configurations","Hiding service banners"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Banner grabbing (also called fingerprinting) involves probing network services to obtain information about their versions, configurations, and other details that could reveal vulnerabilities.",why_others_wrong:"Stealing network banners is not the reconnaissance technique. Creating fake banners would be deception, not information gathering. Hiding service banners would be a defensive measure, not reconnaissance."},{id:67,question:"What characterizes a 'Connect scan' in port scanning?",options:["It never completes connections","It only sends UDP packets","It's completely undetectable","It fully connects to the target with complete TCP handshake"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"A Connect scan establishes complete TCP connections using the full three-way handshake, making it reliable but easily detected and logged.",why_others_wrong:"Never completing connections describes SYN scans, not Connect scans.

Connect scans are highly detectable, not undetectable."},{id:68,question:"In session replay attacks, what does the attacker typically do?",options:["Create new sessions or utilize old sessions","Intercept live communications","Crash the server","Modify network hardware"],correctAnswer:0,explanation:"In session replay attacks, the attacker captures session tokens or URLs and reuses them to create new sessions or replay old sessions, rather than intercepting live communications.",why_others_wrong:"Intercepting live communications describes man-in-the-middle attacks. Crashing the server would be a denial-of-service attack. Modifying network hardware would be physical tampering, not session replay."},{id:69,question:"What makes ARP spoofing possible?",options:["ARP encryption is weak","ARP requests are not tracked, not authenticated, and machines trust other devices","ARP uses old protocols","ARP is only used on wireless networks"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"ARP spoofing is possible because ARP requests are not tracked or authenticated, machines inherently trust responses from other devices, and the ARP table is updated whenever responses are received.",why_others_wrong:"ARP is not encrypted at all, which contributes to the vulnerability but isn't about weak encryption. ARP being an older protocol doesn't directly enable spoofing. ARP is used on all Ethernet networks, not just wireless."},{id:70,question:"What is the primary goal of active sniffing attacks?",options:["To remain completely undetected","To only observe traffic passively","To intercept and force traffic through the attacker's device","To shut down network interfaces"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Active sniffing attacks intercept and force network traffic to flow through the attacker's device, allowing them to capture traffic that wouldn't normally be visible to them.",why_others_wrong:"Remaining undetected is more characteristic of passive sniffing.

Speed comparison to encryption is about performance, not collision resistance."},{id:72,question:"What is the purpose of padding in hash functions?",options:["To make hashes longer","To ensure input meets specific length requirements before hashing","To encrypt the hash","To compress the data"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Padding ensures the input message meets specific length requirements for the hash function to process correctly, typically involving adding bits and the original message length.",why_others_wrong:"Making hashes longer is not the purpose - hash output length is fixed. Encrypting the hash would be a separate operation. Compressing data is not what padding does - it actually adds data."},{id:73,question:"In the Vigenère cipher, what makes it more secure than a simple Caesar cipher?",options:["It uses larger alphabets","It's faster to compute","It uses numbers instead of letters","It uses a keyword to create multiple substitution alphabets (polyalphabetic)"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"The Vigenère cipher is polyalphabetic, using a keyword to create multiple substitution alphabets, making frequency analysis much more difficult than with Caesar cipher's single substitution.",why_others_wrong:"Using larger alphabets is not the key difference. Being faster to compute doesn't make it more secure. Using numbers instead of letters is not characteristic of the Vigenère cipher."},{id:74,question:"What is the key difference between substitution and transposition ciphers?",options:["Substitution is always stronger","Substitution replaces characters, transposition rearranges character positions","Transposition is faster","No difference"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Substitution ciphers replace plaintext characters with other characters, while transposition ciphers rearrange the positions of characters without changing the characters themselves.",why_others_wrong:"Neither is always stronger - strength depends on implementation and key management.

There are fundamental differences in how they transform plaintext."},{id:75,question:"Why are prime numbers important in cryptography?",options:["They are easy to calculate","They make encryption faster","They are used in all ciphers","The difficulty of factorizing the product of large primes ensures security"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Prime numbers are crucial in public-key cryptography because the computational difficulty of factorizing the product of two large primes provides the mathematical foundation for security in algorithms like RSA.",why_others_wrong:"Large primes are actually difficult to find and verify. Prime-based operations are typically slower than other operations. Prime numbers are not used in all ciphers - many symmetric ciphers don't use them."},{id:76,question:"What is entropy in the context of cryptography?",options:["The speed of encryption","The size of the key","The complexity of the algorithm","The level of randomness or unpredictability in a system"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Entropy measures the level of randomness or unpredictability in a cryptographic system. Higher entropy means better security because it prevents patterns and makes attacks more difficult.",why_others_wrong:"Encryption speed is about performance, not entropy. Key size contributes to entropy but is not entropy itself. Algorithm complexity is about computational requirements, not randomness."},{id:77,question:"What is the main advantage of asymmetric encryption over symmetric encryption for key distribution?",options:["It's faster","It uses shorter keys","It's more secure in all cases","It solves the key distribution problem - no need to securely share keys beforehand"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Asymmetric encryption solves the key distribution problem because public keys can be shared openly while private keys remain secret, eliminating the need to securely exchange shared keys beforehand.",why_others_wrong:"Asymmetric encryption is actually slower than symmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption typically uses longer keys, not shorter ones. Each type has security advantages in different scenarios."},{id:78,question:"What does MAC stand for in cryptography?",options:["Media Access Control","Message Authentication Code","Maximum Authentication Cipher","Minimum Access Control"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"MAC stands for Message Authentication Code, which is a keyed hash function that provides both authentication and integrity verification using a shared secret key.",why_others_wrong:"Media Access Control is a networking concept related to hardware addresses.

Frequency analysis examines the frequency of characters or patterns in ciphertext."},{id:80,question:"What is a known plaintext attack?",options:["When the attacker knows the algorithm","When the attacker knows the key length","When the attacker has physical access","When the attacker has access to both plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"A known plaintext attack occurs when an attacker has both the plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext, which they can analyze to potentially discover the encryption key or algorithm weaknesses.",why_others_wrong:"Knowing the algorithm is assumed in cryptanalysis (Kerckhoffs's principle). Knowing key length helps but is different from having plaintext-ciphertext pairs. Physical access enables different types of attacks but not specifically known plaintext attacks."},{id:81,question:"What is the primary concern with quantum computing for current cryptography?",options:["It makes encryption faster","It could theoretically break many current encryption methods","It uses too much power","It's too expensive"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Quantum computing poses a threat to current cryptography because quantum algorithms could theoretically break many existing encryption methods, particularly those based on factoring large numbers or discrete logarithm problems.",why_others_wrong:"Making encryption faster would be beneficial, not a concern.

It achieves this by applying DES encryption three times with different keys.",why_others_wrong:"3DES is actually slower than DES because it performs encryption three times. The key size is larger, not smaller, which is what provides the security benefit. Implementation is more complex, not simpler, due to the triple encryption process."},{id:6,question:"Why has RC4 been deprecated in modern cryptographic applications?",options:["It's too slow for practical use","It only works with small key sizes","It requires too much memory","It has several identified security weaknesses"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"RC4 has been deprecated due to several identified security weaknesses, including biased keystream generation and vulnerabilities in key scheduling. These weaknesses made it unsuitable for secure applications, leading to its removal from protocols like TLS.",why_others_wrong:"RC4 was actually known for being fast, not slow - speed was one of its advantages. It supports key lengths up to 2048 bits, not just small keys.

Anyone can verify the signature using the sender's public key, confirming the message's authenticity.",why_others_wrong:"Confidentiality requires encryption with the receiver's public key, not signing. Integrity is provided but it's not the only benefit - authentication and non-repudiation are equally important. Availability refers to system uptime and accessibility, which digital signatures don't directly provide."},{id:16,question:"What is the main difference between HMAC and digital signature for message authentication?",options:["HMAC is faster but digital signatures provide non-repudiation","Digital signatures are always more secure","HMAC only works with hash functions","Digital signatures cannot verify integrity"],correctAnswer:0,explanation:"HMAC uses symmetric keys and is faster but cannot provide non-repudiation since both parties share the same key. Digital signatures use asymmetric cryptography, are slower, but provide non-repudiation since only the sender has the private key used for signing.",why_others_wrong:"Security depends on implementation and use case - neither is always more secure. While HMAC uses hash functions, digital signatures also typically use hash functions in their process.

XSS attacks don't involve encryption methods."},{id:53,question:"What is the main security benefit of using Content Security Policy (CSP) nonces?",options:["They encrypt script content","They provide unique identifiers to allow only specific scripts to execute","They improve script performance","They compress script size"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"CSP nonces are unique, unpredictable values that must be included in script tags for them to execute. This prevents XSS attacks because attackers cannot predict the nonce value, so their injected scripts will be blocked by the CSP policy.",why_others_wrong:"Nonces don't encrypt content - they're authorization tokens. Performance and compression are not security benefits provided by nonces - they're purely for access control."},{id:54,question:"What type of attack does input validation primarily defend against?",options:["Denial of Service attacks","Injection attacks (SQL, XSS, Command injection)","Man-in-the-middle attacks","Brute force attacks"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Input validation primarily defends against injection attacks by ensuring that user input conforms to expected formats and doesn't contain malicious code. It prevents SQL injection, XSS, command injection, and other attacks that rely on inserting malicious content through user input fields.",why_others_wrong:"DoS attacks often target resource exhaustion, not input processing.

This makes it much more resistant to brute force attacks compared to fast hash functions like SHA-256, which can be computed millions of times per second.",why_others_wrong:"Bcrypt hashes are similar length to SHA-256, not shorter. Bcrypt is intentionally slower, not faster, to resist brute force attacks. Both bcrypt and SHA-256 can handle various input sizes."},{id:56,question:"What is the primary purpose of the Same-Origin Policy in web browsers?",options:["To improve page loading speed","To prevent scripts from one origin accessing data from another origin","To compress web content","To manage browser cache"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Same-Origin Policy prevents scripts loaded from one domain from accessing data or resources from another domain without permission. This fundamental security mechanism protects against cross-site attacks and unauthorized data access between different websites.",why_others_wrong:"Same-Origin Policy can actually slow down some operations by preventing certain cross-origin requests.

Salting adds random data to passwords before hashing, ensuring identical passwords produce different hashes, making precomputed rainbow tables ineffective since attackers would need separate tables for each salt.",why_others_wrong:"Rainbow tables are password cracking tools, not network attacks. Salting doesn't increase password length - it adds random data to the hash input. Salting doesn't change the original passwords, just their hash computation."},{id:60,question:"What is the primary security weakness of ECB mode compared to CBC mode?",options:["ECB is slower than CBC","ECB reveals patterns in plaintext data","ECB requires larger keys","ECB cannot handle large files"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"ECB encrypts identical plaintext blocks to identical ciphertext blocks, revealing patterns in the original data. This makes it possible to identify repeated content and potentially reconstruct parts of the original message, while CBC mode eliminates these patterns through chaining.",why_others_wrong:"ECB is actually faster than CBC because it doesn't require chaining between blocks.

This solves the key distribution problem that exists with symmetric cryptography where both parties need to securely share the same secret key.",why_others_wrong:"Public key cryptography is much slower than symmetric encryption, not faster. Keys are typically much larger (2048+ bits vs 128-256 bits).

Direct password theft and network configuration access are not the main XXE attack vectors."},{id:6,question:"Which command injection payload would typically be used to view the contents of the /etc/passwd file on a Linux system?",options:["; SELECT * FROM users","; alert('XSS')","; DROP TABLE users","; cat /etc/passwd"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"The semicolon (;) is used to chain commands in Unix/Linux systems, and 'cat /etc/passwd' is the standard command to display the contents of the password file. This is a typical command injection payload for Linux systems.",why_others_wrong:"The SELECT statement is SQL syntax, not OS commands. The alert() function is JavaScript for XSS attacks. DROP TABLE is also SQL syntax for database manipulation, not OS command injection."},{id:7,question:"What characterizes a Directory Traversal (Path Traversal) attack?",options:["Injecting SQL commands into input fields","Using ../ sequences to access files outside the web root","Executing JavaScript in the browser","Forging HTTP requests"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Directory Traversal attacks use sequences like '../' to navigate up directory levels and access files outside the intended web root directory. This allows attackers to read sensitive system files that should not be accessible through the web application.",why_others_wrong:"SQL injection involves database commands, not file system navigation. JavaScript execution is XSS. HTTP request forgery is CSRF. Directory traversal specifically involves manipulating file paths."},{id:8,question:"According to the NIST definition, what is malware?",options:["Any software that requires administrator privileges","Software that monitors network traffic","A program inserted covertly to compromise CIA properties","Any program that modifies system files"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"NIST 800-83 defines malware as 'a program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly, with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim's data, applications, or operating system.' The key aspects are covert insertion and intent to compromise CIA properties.",why_others_wrong:"Programs requiring admin privileges aren't necessarily malicious. Network monitoring tools can be legitimate. File modification alone doesn't make software malicious - the covert nature and malicious intent are crucial defining factors."},{id:9,question:"What are the three phases of the malware lifecycle?",options:["Creation, Distribution, Activation","Infection, Execution, Payload","Install, Run, Destroy","Upload, Download, Execute"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"The malware lifecycle consists of three phases: Infection (how it gets in), Execution (when and how it runs), and Payload (what it does). This lifecycle helps classify and understand how malware operates and persists.",why_others_wrong:"Creation, Distribution, Activation describe development phases, not operational phases. Install, Run, Destroy oversimplifies the process. Upload, Download, Execute are network operations, not malware lifecycle phases."},{id:10,question:"Which type of malware is described as 'standalone' and can run independently once installed?",options:["Virus","Trojan Horse","Rootkit","Worm"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Worms are independent malware that can run on their own once installed on a compromised machine. They actively seek out other machines to infect and don't require a host program to function, unlike viruses.",why_others_wrong:"Viruses require host programs to run. Trojan horses disguise themselves as legitimate software but still need user interaction. Rootkits typically modify existing system components rather than operating independently."},{id:11,question:"What distinguishes a virus from a worm in terms of propagation?",options:["Viruses spread through email, worms through networks","Viruses require host programs, worms are self-replicating","Viruses are encrypted, worms are not","Viruses target files, worms target systems"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"The key distinction is that viruses need to attach to and infect host programs to spread, while worms are self-replicating and can propagate independently across networks without requiring host programs.",why_others_wrong:"Both can spread through various means including email and networks. Encryption is not a distinguishing factor. While they may have different targets, the fundamental difference is in their dependency on host programs for replication."},{id:12,question:"Which virus classification hides itself from detection by anti-virus software?",options:["Polymorphic virus","Stealth virus","Macro virus","Boot sector virus"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Stealth viruses are explicitly designed to hide themselves from detection by anti-virus software using various evasion techniques such as intercepting system calls and providing false information to scanning programs.",why_others_wrong:"Polymorphic viruses change their code but don't necessarily hide from detection. Macro viruses infect documents with macro code. Boot sector viruses infect the master boot record. Only stealth viruses specifically focus on avoiding detection."},{id:13,question:"What type of virus changes its code with every infection to avoid signature-based detection?",options:["Stealth virus","Metamorphic virus","Polymorphic virus","Encrypted virus"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Polymorphic viruses mutate their code with every infection while maintaining the same functionality. This makes them difficult to detect using traditional signature-based antivirus methods that look for specific code patterns.",why_others_wrong:"Stealth viruses hide but don't necessarily change code. Metamorphic viruses also change but rewrite themselves completely, not just mutate. Encrypted viruses use encryption but don't necessarily change their underlying code structure."},{id:14,question:"What is the primary difference between a metamorphic and polymorphic virus?",options:["Metamorphic viruses are encrypted, polymorphic are not","Metamorphic viruses target boot sectors, polymorphic target files","Metamorphic viruses spread faster than polymorphic","Metamorphic viruses completely rewrite themselves, polymorphic just mutate"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Metamorphic viruses completely rewrite themselves at each iteration and may change behavior as well as appearance, while polymorphic viruses only mutate their code while keeping the same basic functionality and structure.",why_others_wrong:"Encryption, target locations, and spreading speed are not the distinguishing factors. The key difference is the extent of code modification - complete rewriting versus mutation of existing code."},{id:15,question:"Which type of malware specifically modifies or replaces system programs to hide its presence?",options:["Virus","Worm","Trojan horse","Rootkit"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Rootkits are designed to modify or replace existing system programs to conceal their presence and maintain persistent access. They operate at a low level to hide processes, files, and network connections from detection.",why_others_wrong:"Viruses infect programs but don't necessarily hide system presence.

Trojans specifically focus on deception and disguise."},{id:17,question:"Which social engineering technique involves extracting information during seemingly normal conversation?",options:["Pretexting","Baiting","Tailgating","Elicitation"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Elicitation is defined as 'the subtle extraction of information during an apparently normal and innocent conversation.' It involves skillfully gathering sensitive information without the target realizing they're being manipulated.",why_others_wrong:"Pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario. Baiting involves offering something enticing to trigger actions. Tailgating is physical unauthorized access by following someone. Only elicitation focuses on subtle information extraction through conversation."},{id:18,question:"What type of social engineering attack involves creating a fabricated scenario to build trust?",options:["Elicitation","Pretexting","Phishing","Vishing"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario or story to build trust and extract information. The attacker assumes a false identity or situation to appear legitimate and gain the victim's confidence.",why_others_wrong:"Elicitation focuses on conversation-based information gathering. Phishing uses fraudulent communications, typically email. Vishing is voice-based phishing. Pretexting specifically involves creating false scenarios to establish trust."},{id:19,question:"According to the lecture notes, what are the three main categories of vulnerabilities that create human attack surfaces?",options:["Ignorance, trust, and greed","Social engineering, human error, and trusted insiders","Phishing, pretexting, and baiting","Physical, psychological, and digital"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"The human attack surface refers to vulnerabilities created by social engineering (tricking people), human error (mistakes), and trusted insiders (authorized personnel who become threats). These represent the main ways humans become security vulnerabilities.",why_others_wrong:"While ignorance, trust, and greed may be factors, they're not the formal categories. Phishing, pretexting, and baiting are specific techniques, not categories.

These three components work together to provide comprehensive access control.",why_others_wrong:"While accounting is related to accountability, the formal AAA model uses Accountability. Access and Availability, though important security concepts, are not part of the standard AAA framework."},{id:21,question:"Which AAA component involves verifying 'who you are'?",options:["Authorization","Authentication","Accountability","Access Control"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Authentication is the process of verifying identity - confirming 'who you are.' It typically involves credentials like passwords, biometrics, or certificates to prove the claimed identity.",why_others_wrong:"Authorization determines 'what you can do' after identity is verified. Accountability tracks 'what you did.' Access Control is a broader concept that encompasses all three AAA components."},{id:22,question:"What is the difference between identification and authentication?",options:["Identification verifies identity, authentication provides identity","Identification provides identity claim, authentication verifies the claim","Identification is for users, authentication is for systems","They are the same process"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Identification is the process of claiming an identity (like providing a username), while authentication is the process of verifying that the claimed identity is legitimate (like providing the correct password for that username).",why_others_wrong:"The first option reverses the definitions. Both processes apply to users and systems. They are distinctly different processes that work together but serve different purposes in access control."},{id:23,question:"Which authentication factor represents 'something you know'?",options:["Fingerprint","Smart card","Password","Location GPS"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Passwords, passphrases, and PINs represent 'something you know' - information that is stored in your memory. This is one of the three main authentication factors in cybersecurity.",why_others_wrong:"Fingerprints are 'something you are' (biometric). Smart cards are 'something you have' (possession). GPS location is 'somewhere you are' (location-based authentication)."},{id:24,question:"What type of authentication token calculates a number synchronized with an authentication server?",options:["Asynchronous token","Smart card","USB token","Synchronous token"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Synchronous tokens calculate numbers that are synchronized with the authentication server, either through time-based synchronization or event-based synchronization. Both the token and server generate the same number at the same time.",why_others_wrong:"Asynchronous tokens don't require calculation or synchronization. Smart cards and USB tokens are physical devices that may or may not use synchronization depending on their implementation."},{id:25,question:"Which biometric authentication method is classified as 'dynamic'?",options:["Fingerprint scanning","Iris recognition","Hand geometry","Keystroke dynamics"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Keystroke dynamics is a dynamic biometric that analyzes behavioral patterns in how you type, including timing and rhythm. Dynamic biometrics measure behavioral characteristics rather than static physical features.",why_others_wrong:"Fingerprints, iris patterns, and hand geometry are static biometrics based on physical characteristics that don't change significantly over time."},{id:26,question:"What is the principle of 'least privilege' in access control?",options:["Users should have the minimum access needed to perform their job","Users should have maximum access for convenience","All users should have the same level of access","Access should be granted based on seniority"],correctAnswer:0,explanation:"The principle of least privilege states that users should be granted only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions. This reduces the potential impact of compromised accounts or insider threats.",why_others_wrong:"Maximum access increases security risks unnecessarily. Equal access ignores different job requirements. Seniority-based access doesn't consider actual job needs and violates the principle of appropriate access levels."},{id:27,question:"What does 'need to know' principle ensure in access control?",options:["Users know their passwords","Users access only information required for their work tasks","Users understand security policies","Users report security incidents"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"The 'need to know' principle ensures that subjects are granted access only to information they need to know for their specific work tasks and job functions, limiting exposure of sensitive information.",why_others_wrong:"Password knowledge, security policy understanding, and incident reporting are important but not what the 'need to know' principle specifically addresses. It focuses specifically on information access limitations."},{id:28,question:"In Discretionary Access Control (DAC), who decides access permissions?",options:["System administrator","Security officer","Resource owner","All users collectively"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"In DAC, the resource owner (the person who created or owns the resource) has the discretion to decide who can access their resources and what level of access to grant. This is why it's called 'discretionary.'",why_others_wrong:"System administrators manage systems but don't necessarily control individual resource access in DAC. Security officers create policies but don't make individual access decisions. Collective user decision-making is not how DAC operates."},{id:29,question:"What characterizes Mandatory Access Control (MAC)?",options:["Users can modify their own permissions","Access is determined by system-wide security policies","All users have equal access rights","Permissions are based on user requests"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"MAC is characterized by system-wide security policies that are centrally controlled by security administrators. Users cannot modify access permissions, and decisions are based on security labels and clearance levels rather than user discretion.",why_others_wrong:"Users cannot modify permissions in MAC (that's DAC). Equal access rights don't consider security levels. User requests don't determine access in MAC - it's based on predetermined security policies and classifications."},{id:30,question:"In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), access permissions are assigned based on:",options:["User identity","Security clearance level","Job roles and responsibilities","Resource sensitivity"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"RBAC assigns permissions based on roles that reflect job functions and responsibilities. Users are assigned to roles, and roles are granted permissions, making access management more efficient and aligned with organizational structure.",why_others_wrong:"User identity is used in DAC. Security clearance levels are used in MAC. Resource sensitivity affects classification but doesn't drive RBAC assignments - job roles do."},{id:31,question:"What makes Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) more flexible than other models?",options:["It uses only user attributes","It requires fewer administrative controls","It works only with predefined roles","It considers multiple attributes of users, resources, and environment"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"ABAC's flexibility comes from its ability to make access decisions based on multiple attributes including user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental conditions (like time of day, location, etc.), allowing for very granular and context-aware access control.",why_others_wrong:"Using only user attributes would be limiting, not flexible. ABAC actually requires more complex administration due to its granular nature. It doesn't rely on predefined roles like RBAC does."},{id:32,question:"What is an Access Control List (ACL)?",options:["A list of all users in the system","A collection of access control entries for a file or resource","A list of security policies","A record of access attempts"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"An ACL is a collection of Access Control Entries (ACEs) that specify which users or groups are granted or denied specific types of access to a particular file, folder, or resource.",why_others_wrong:"A user list doesn't specify permissions. Security policies are broader than ACLs. Access attempt records are audit logs, not access control mechanisms."},{id:33,question:"Which protocol uses UDP as its transport mechanism?",options:["TACACS+","RADIUS","Diameter","Kerberos"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) uses UDP as its transport protocol, which makes it simpler but less reliable than TCP-based protocols. This is one of the key differences between RADIUS and TACACS+.",why_others_wrong:"TACACS+ and Diameter both use TCP for more reliable transmission. Kerberos uses both UDP and TCP depending on the message size and type."},{id:34,question:"What advantage does TACACS+ have over RADIUS?",options:["Uses UDP for faster transmission","Requires less network bandwidth","Works only with Cisco devices","Provides more sophisticated authentication and authorization control"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"TACACS+ provides more sophisticated authentication steps and tighter control over complex authorization activities compared to RADIUS. It also uses TCP, which provides more reliable transmission than RADIUS's UDP.",why_others_wrong:"TACACS+ uses TCP, not UDP. It typically uses more bandwidth due to TCP overhead. While developed by Cisco, TACACS+ is not limited to Cisco devices."},{id:35,question:"What is the primary purpose of Kerberos?",options:["File encryption","Network monitoring","User authentication and key distribution","Intrusion detection"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Kerberos is primarily designed to provide authentication for client/server applications and secure key distribution using symmetric cryptography. It's a network authentication protocol that uses tickets to verify identity.",why_others_wrong:"While Kerberos involves cryptography, it's not primarily for file encryption. It doesn't monitor networks or detect intrusions - its focus is on authentication and secure key management."},{id:36,question:"In Kerberos, what is a 'ticket'?",options:["A user password","An encrypted authentication token","A network address","A public key certificate"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"In Kerberos, a ticket is an encrypted authentication token that contains information about the user's identity and access permissions. It's used to authenticate users to services without transmitting passwords over the network.",why_others_wrong:"Passwords are what users provide initially. Network addresses identify locations, not authentication status. Public key certificates are used in PKI systems, while Kerberos uses symmetric cryptography."},{id:37,question:"What does Single Sign-On (SSO) primarily provide?",options:["Multiple passwords for enhanced security","One password for all corporate systems and applications","Automatic password generation","Password encryption services"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"SSO allows users to access multiple corporate systems and applications using a single set of credentials, improving user experience while potentially enhancing security by reducing password management overhead.",why_others_wrong:"Multiple passwords would be the opposite of SSO. While SSO systems may generate session tokens, automatic password generation isn't their primary function. Password encryption is a component but not the main purpose."},{id:38,question:"Which component of malware determines when the payload is activated?",options:["Infection mechanism","Trigger","Propagation method","Payload"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"The trigger (sometimes known as a logic bomb) is the component that determines when the payload is activated or delivered. It could be a specific date, system condition, or user action that causes the malware to execute its malicious function.",why_others_wrong:"The infection mechanism is how malware spreads. Propagation methods are how it replicates. The payload is what executes, but the trigger determines when it executes."},{id:39,question:"During which phase of the virus lifecycle does the virus copy itself to other programs?",options:["Dormant phase","Triggering phase","Propagation phase","Execution phase"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"During the propagation phase, the virus places copies of itself into other programs or system areas on the disk. This is when the actual replication and spreading occurs.",why_others_wrong:"The dormant phase is when the virus is idle. The triggering phase activates the virus. The execution phase is when the virus performs its intended malicious function, not when it replicates."},{id:40,question:"What type of malware payload is designed to steal keystrokes?",options:["System corruption","Keylogger","Backdoor","Bot"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Keyloggers are designed specifically to capture and steal keystrokes, enabling attackers to monitor all user input including passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information.",why_others_wrong:"System corruption payloads damage systems. Backdoors provide unauthorized access. Bots allow remote control. Only keyloggers specifically focus on keystroke capture."},{id:41,question:"What is the primary characteristic of a botnet?",options:["It encrypts files for ransom","It monitors network traffic","It modifies system files","It's a collection of compromised computers controlled remotely"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"A botnet is a collection of compromised computers (bots or zombies) that can be controlled remotely by cybercriminals to perform coordinated attacks like DDoS, send spam, or mine cryptocurrency.",why_others_wrong:"File encryption for ransom is characteristic of ransomware. Network monitoring is done by legitimate tools or spyware. System file modification is done by various malware types, but doesn't define botnets specifically."},{id:42,question:"Which generation of antivirus software uses heuristic rules for detection?",options:["First generation","Second generation","Third generation","Fourth generation"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Second generation antivirus software introduced heuristic rules for probable malware detection, moving beyond simple signature-based detection to identify potentially malicious behavior patterns.",why_others_wrong:"First generation relied only on signatures. Third generation used memory-resident programs and activity monitoring. Fourth generation combined multiple techniques including scanning, activity traps, and access control."},{id:43,question:"What does 'security through obscurity' mean in the context of robots.txt files?",options:["Files are encrypted for security","Security relies on hiding rather than strong protection","Only administrators can access the files","Files are stored in secure locations"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Security through obscurity means relying on hiding information (like directories in robots.txt) rather than implementing strong security controls. This is generally considered a weak security approach because hidden information can still be discovered and accessed.",why_others_wrong:"Encryption, administrative access controls, and secure storage are actual security measures, not obscurity. Obscurity specifically refers to hiding rather than protecting."},{id:44,question:"In a Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack, what does '../' represent?",options:["A file extension","Directory traversal to parent directory","A server command","An SQL injection payload"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"'../' is used for directory traversal, allowing attackers to navigate up to parent directories and potentially access files outside the intended web directory structure. Multiple '../' sequences can traverse multiple directory levels.",why_others_wrong:"File extensions typically come after dots (like .txt). Server commands have different syntax. SQL injection uses database-specific syntax, not file system navigation commands."},{id:45,question:"What is the main difference between Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI)?",options:["LFI affects databases, RFI affects files","LFI includes files from the same server, RFI includes files from remote servers","LFI is more dangerous than RFI","LFI uses HTTP, RFI uses HTTPS"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"LFI includes files from the local server (same system), while RFI includes files from remote servers over the network. RFI is generally considered more dangerous as it allows attackers to execute code hosted on their own servers.",why_others_wrong:"Both affect file inclusion, not specifically databases. RFI is typically more dangerous than LFI. Both can use various protocols; the distinction is local vs. remote file location."},{id:46,question:"Which HTTP response code typically indicates a successful SQL injection attempt?",options:["404 Not Found","200 OK with unexpected data","500 Internal Server Error","403 Forbidden"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"A successful SQL injection often returns a 200 OK response but with unexpected or additional data that wasn't intended to be displayed, such as database records from other tables or system information.",why_others_wrong:"404 indicates the resource wasn't found. 500 errors might indicate a failed injection attempt that caused an error. 403 indicates access is forbidden. Success is indicated by getting the expected response with unexpected data."},{id:47,question:"What is the purpose of the UNION operator in SQL injection attacks?",options:["To delete database records","To update existing records","To create new database tables","To combine results from multiple SELECT statements"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"The UNION operator in SQL is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements. In SQL injection attacks, it's used to append additional SELECT queries to extract data from other tables or databases.",why_others_wrong:"DELETE removes records, UPDATE modifies existing records, and CREATE creates new objects. UNION specifically combines query results, making it useful for extracting additional data in injections."},{id:48,question:"What information can typically be extracted from the information_schema in SQL injection attacks?",options:["User passwords","Database structure and metadata","Network configurations","System files"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"The information_schema contains metadata about the database structure, including table names, column names, data types, and other schema information. This is valuable for attackers to understand the database structure for more targeted attacks.",why_others_wrong:"User passwords are stored in application-specific tables, not information_schema.
